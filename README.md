Simple evolution simulator

The simulator displays inidividuals (‘bugs’) as little circles. Each
bug has a 16 letter genome/proteome/metabolome (‘stuffome’). stuffomes
have a vocab of 20 letters, 10 synonymous pairs.
If a bug has a specific survival sequence (‘EICOMPEPAPITA’) in its
stuffome, it can eat and survive. Eating gives the bug Energy, and
subtracts Energy from the common resource (“Energy Pool”). If a bug has
enough energy, it reproduces. The daughter bug has a certain chance to
mutate. If there is not enough food available, a bug dies.
You can view the population and resource level graphs.

Future plans include antibiotic resistance simulations
